### Dissertation Repository Description

**Repository Name:** *Optimized Data Preparation for Predictive Process Monitoring Using Large Language Models (LLMs)*

---

#### **Overview**
This repository contains the full implementation, data, and results supporting the dissertation:  
**"Optimized Data Preparation Pipelines for Predictive Process Monitoring Using LLMs."**

Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) relies heavily on high-quality event logs for accurate predictions and insights. This research explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenges in data preparation, including missing values, synonym transformations, and homonym ambiguity. The repository demonstrates how LLM-based imputation enhances data quality, resulting in improved PPM performance.

#### **Key Features**
- **LLM-Based Data Imputation:** Python scripts for restoring missing values and handling semantic variability in event logs using LLMs like GPT or LLaMA.
- **Synonym and Homonym Transformation Tools:** Utilities for generating transformed datasets to simulate real-world challenges.
- **PPM Model Evaluation:** End-to-end pipeline to train and evaluate PPM models using both classic and LLM-enhanced datasets.
- **Performance Metrics and Analysis:** Detailed metrics (accuracy, F1-score) and visualizations comparing LLM-based and traditional methods.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yeoonsu/dissertation.git
   cd dissertation
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Experiments**:
   - Generate transformed datasets:
     ```bash
     python experiments/preprocessing/transform_data.py --dataset credit --transformation synonym
     ```
   - Train a PPM model:
     ```bash
     python experiments/training/train_ppm.py --dataset credit --method llm
     ```
   - Evaluate performance:
     ```bash
     python experiments/evaluation/evaluate_model.py --dataset credit --method llm
     ```

4. **Visualize Results**:
   - Accuracy and F1-score plots:
     ```bash
     python experiments/evaluation/plot_results.py --output results/figures/
     ```
